# BucketList

A bucketlist app built using SvelteKit, NodeJS, PocketBase and some Vanilla Javascript!

## Testing this out yourself:

- Clone the repo.
- In the bucketlist directory: `npm run dev` then `./pocketbase serve` (You do have to be running windows for the pocketbase executable to serve).
- If you aren't running windows, simply drop the PocketBase Linux/ Mac executable inside the repo, replacing the `pocketbase.exe` file.
- And you're done.
